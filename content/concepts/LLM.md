An **LLM** (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand, generate, and process human-like text based on vast amounts of text data it has been trained on. Utilizing deep learning architectures, particularly transformer networks, LLMs can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including summarization, translation, question answering, content creation, and code generation.
